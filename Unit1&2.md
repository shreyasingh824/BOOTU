## **Unit I: Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures**

### **1. What is asymptotic notation? Explain the various types in detail.**
Asymptotic notation is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps analyze the performance of algorithms in terms of input size. It provides a high-level understanding of how an algorithm scales and behaves as the input grows, disregarding constant factors and lower-order terms.

#### **Types of Asymptotic Notation:**
1. **Big O Notation (O):** Represents the upper bound of an algorithm’s running time. It tells us the worst-case scenario for an algorithm, ensuring that it does not take longer than the given bound.
   - Example: **O(n²) for Bubble Sort** – The worst-case scenario occurs when the input is in reverse order, leading to n² swaps.

2. **Big Omega Notation (Ω):** Represents the lower bound of an algorithm. It defines the best-case complexity and guarantees that the algorithm will take at least this much time.
   - Example: **Ω(n) for Quick Sort** – If the pivot is chosen optimally, Quick Sort performs in linear time.

3. **Big Theta Notation (Θ):** Provides a tight bound on algorithm complexity, meaning the algorithm will always execute within this bound, in both best and worst cases.
   - Example: **Θ(n log n) for Merge Sort** – The algorithm consistently performs in n log n time.

4. **Little o Notation (o):** Represents a bound that is not tight. It states that an algorithm will take significantly fewer steps compared to a given function.
   - Example: **o(n²) means the complexity is significantly less than n²**.

5. **Little omega Notation (ω):** The inverse of Little o notation, describing an algorithm that takes more steps than a given function but without an upper bound.

### **2. What is complexity of an algorithm? Explain various notations used to express the complexity of an algorithm.**
The **complexity of an algorithm** measures the amount of time and space required to execute an algorithm based on input size **n**. Complexity can be categorized into:
- **Time Complexity:** Number of basic operations executed.
- **Space Complexity:** Amount of memory used by the algorithm.

#### **Common Complexity Classes:**
- **O(1) – Constant Time:** The execution time remains the same regardless of input size. Example: Accessing an array element using an index.
- **O(log n) – Logarithmic Time:** The time increases logarithmically as the input grows. Example: Binary Search.
- **O(n) – Linear Time:** The execution time is directly proportional to input size. Example: Linear Search.
- **O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time:** More efficient than quadratic algorithms. Example: Merge Sort.
- **O(n²) – Quadratic Time:** Used for algorithms that process pairs of elements. Example: Bubble Sort.
- **O(2ⁿ) – Exponential Time:** Growth doubles with each additional input. Example: Recursive Fibonacci.

### **3. Explain Big O Notation with examples.**
Big O notation helps express the worst-case scenario of an algorithm’s complexity. The notation ignores constants and lower-order terms to focus on the most significant impact.

#### **Examples:**
- **Loop running `n` times:** O(n) complexity.
- **Nested loop running `n × n` times:** O(n²) complexity.
- **Binary search halving input each step:** O(log n) complexity.
- **Recursive Fibonacci (exponential growth):** O(2ⁿ) complexity.

### **4. Linear Arrays and Address Calculation**
#### **Given:**
- AAA [5:50], BBB [-5:10], CCC [1:8]

#### **Finding Number of Elements:**
  - AAA: (50 - 5 + 1) = 46
  - BBB: (10 - (-5) + 1) = 16
  - CCC: (8 - 1 + 1) = 8

#### **Memory Address Calculation:**
Memory address in arrays is calculated using:
  - **Formula:** `Address(A[i]) = Base + (i - lower_bound) * size`
  - **Example:** AAA [15], AAA [35], AAA [55]

## **Unit II: Stacks, Queues, and Recursion**

### **5. Stack: PUSH and POP Operations**
A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. The last inserted element is the first to be removed.

#### **Operations:**
- **PUSH:** Inserts an element at the top.
- **POP:** Removes the top element.

#### **C Implementation:**
```c
void push(int stack[], int *top, int item) {
    stack[++(*top)] = item;
}
int pop(int stack[], int *top) {
    return stack[(*top)--];
}
```

### **6. Tower of Hanoi Problem**
The **Tower of Hanoi** is a recursive puzzle where `n` disks must be moved from one peg to another using an auxiliary peg, without placing a larger disk on a smaller one.

#### **Steps:**
1. Move `n-1` disks to auxiliary peg.
2. Move the largest disk to the destination peg.
3. Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to destination peg.

#### **C Implementation:**
```c
void hanoi(int n, char from, char to, char aux) {
    if (n == 1) {
        printf("Move disk from %c to %c", from, to);
        return;
    }
    hanoi(n - 1, from, aux, to);
    hanoi(n - 1, aux, to, from);
}
```

### **7. Circular Queue Implementation**
A **circular queue** overcomes limitations of linear queues by treating the array as circular.

#### **C Implementation:**
```c
void insert(int queue[], int *front, int *rear, int size, int item) {
    *rear = (*rear + 1) % size;
    queue[*rear] = item;
}
```
